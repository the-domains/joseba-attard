description: >-

  Sometimes life requires taking some big risks, to jump into something where
  you're not sure of the outcome. Some people call it foolishness, Jack Kerouac
  might call it crazy. 


  We're taking that jump, leaving the security of "the shire" behind us. Quite
  simply, to us, it is a leap of faith.
